# Guess-number-game define
The guessing number game is a simple and classic game where a player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The game typically follows these steps:

# Initialization:

The game starts by generating a random target number within a specified range (e.g., between x1 and x2).
# 1.Player Guess:

The player makes a guess by selecting a number within the given range and submits it to the system.
# 2.Feedback:

The system provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
# 3.Iteration:

The player continues to make guesses until they either correctly guess the target number or reach a maximum number of allowed attempts (n).
#＃　4.Outcome:

The game ends with a congratulatory message if the player guesses the correct number, along with the number of attempts made. If the player exceeds the maximum allowed attempts, the system reveals the correct number.
Here's a simple flowchart to illustrate the process:
